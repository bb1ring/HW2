## Problem 1

``` r
transit_df =
  read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
           na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada)|>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", 1, 0))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32

    ## Delimiter: ","

This dataset contains division, the name of subway lines, station names
on each line, routes served at each station, station’s longitude and
latitude, station’s orientation, whether the station has entry and
vending, each station’s entrance type, entrance’s longitude and
latitude, and ADA compliance. I clear the names of variables in the
dataset, and selected the variables we need. I have changed variable
“entry” from character to a numeric varible, result in 1868 rows and 32
colomns in the dataset. However, these data are still not tidy enough.

``` r
stations = transit_df |>
  select(station_name, line) |>
  distinct()
n_stations = nrow(stations)

ada_stations = transit_df|>
  filter(ada == "TRUE") |>
  distinct(line, station_name)
n_ada = nrow(ada_stations)

no_vending = transit_df|>
  filter(vending == "NO") |>
  pull(entry) |>
  mean()
```

There are 465 distinct stations. 84 stations are ADA compliant. About
37.7% of station entrances/exits don’t have vending allow entrance.

``` r
route_df = transit_df |>
  mutate(across(route1:route11, as.character))|>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name"
  )
  
a_stations = route_df|>
  filter(route_name == "A") |>
  distinct(line, station_name)

ada_a_stations = route_df |>
  filter(route_name == "A", ada == "TRUE") |>
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train. 17 of the stations
that serve the A trains are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

``` r
mr_trash = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:N653", na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)),
         trash_wheel_name = "Mr.Trash Wheel",
         year = as.character(year)) 

prof_trash = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:M120", na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trash_wheel_name = "Professor Trash Wheel",
         year = as.character(year))

gwynnda = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:L265", na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trash_wheel_name = "Gwynnda",
         year = as.character(year))
```

``` r
combined_data = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash, prof_trash, gwynnda)|>
  rename(date_of_collection = date,
         month_of_collection = month,
         year_of_collection = year,
         total_weight_tons = weight_tons)|>
  arrange(year_of_collection) |>
  select(-dumpster)|>
  relocate(trash_wheel_name)

n_obs = nrow(combined_data)
```

``` r
mr_trash_weight = mr_trash |>
  pull(weight_tons) |>
  sum()

prof_trash_weight = prof_trash |>
  pull(weight_tons) |>
  sum()

gwynnda_weight = gwynnda |>
  pull(weight_tons) |>
  sum()

gwynnda_cig = gwynnda |>
  filter(month == "June", 
         year == 2022) |>
  pull(cigarette_butts) |>
  sum()
```

The combined dataset has 1032 observations. Key variables include
dumpter number, date of collection, amount of total litter and litter
type. Mr.Trash wheel started collected trash in 2014. Professor Trash
wheel started in 2017. Gwynnda started in 2021. Mr.Trash wheel collected
a total of 2091.18 tons of trash. Professor Trash Wheel collected a
total of 246.74 tons of trash. Gwynnda collected a total of 797.55 tons
of trash. In June 2022, Gwynnda collected 1.812^{4} cigarette butts.

  relocate(series, episode, baker_name)

write_csv(final_data, "data/final_dataset.csv")
```

I imported these three datasets and cleaned the variables’ names. Then,
I went through each dataset to arrange them in a reasonable way and
check if there were any differences among them. I noticed that only the
`bakers` dataset included the full names of bakers. I extract the first
name so that I can merge these dataset by name. Then, I checked the
completeness and correctness across data sets by using `anti_join`.
There was one baker’s name was inconsistent in bakes dataset, so I
correct the name. It also showed me that only the `bakers` dataset
contains information from season 9 and 10. Finally, I merged datasets by
using `left_join`, and relocated some variables.

The final dataset includes eahc bakers in every season and episode. The
basic information about each baker, like age, hometown, their signature
bake, and their results, were displayed in the final dataset.

``` r
star_baker_table =
  filter(final_data, series >= 5) |>
  select(series, episode, baker_name, result) |>
  arrange(series, episode) |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Star Bakers and Winners for Seasons 5 to 10",
    col.names = c("Season", "Episode Number", "Bakers' Name", "Results")
)
```

In reviewing the Star Baker table from Seasons 5 through 10, several
trends emerged. Candice Brown in season 7 secured the Star Baker title
several times, indicating their strong performance in various
challenges, which may suggest a predictable overall winner. Conversely,
Nancy Birtwhistle’s victory in Season 5 was surprising, as Richard Burr
has secured the Star Baker title multiple times.

    cols = series_1:series_10,
    names_to = "series",
    values_to = "viewers"

season 5 is 10.0393.
